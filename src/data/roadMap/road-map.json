  "content": "This collection was created by Dan Yatsinko, inspired by the delicate balance between life and death. Half Dead is a collection of 4,000 randomly generated, unique artworks encoded on the Solana blockchain.\n\n\n\n# ORIGIN STORY:\n\nOn top of a hill, in the far corner of town lived an old inventor. His enormous house looked as if it was once alive but now beginning to slowly decompose from the inside out. He had no real friends, or family and the towns people hated him. None of which had a real reason to, in reality they just didn’t understand him . He was unique… One of a kind… a rarity. They thought he was weird and treated him like a complete outsider even though he lived there for over 50 years. \n\nOne dark night, under a blood red moon he decided to make his own friends and family. However, what he created was not fully alive, but rather half dead. More comparable to a zombie pet - far from a human companion - but the inventor didn’t care! He had friends…. FINALLY! These friends may be the embodiment of pure evil but they love and protect him…. No one else gets the inventor like they do, because they are living extensions of him.\n\nStill to this day they follow his lead and do whatever he says…. which sometimes means wreaking havoc on the unsuspecting towns people.\n\n\n\n# ROADMAP:\n\n## Pre Launch\n\nThis collection will set the tone for what will be an ever expanding 'Half Dead' world that will translate into the meta verse. Consider this your introduction to the inventor and his demonic creations.\n\n\n\n## Mint\n\nNovember 26, 2021 we will mint 4,000 individual Half Dead at a price or .36 sol.\n\n\n\n## Post Launch\n\nAfter launch we will continue to keep bringing the \"half dead\" to life in many different ways. \n\nWe will be using the royalties to fund, develop and produce more content. \n\nWe want to be engaged with out community as much as possible, rewarding those who dare enter the Half Dead realm. \n\n## Rewards\n\nThe main goal is to create and sustain a fun, gross place for all of our anger to run free! \\\nPost launch we will airdrop sound bites of each character that can be claimed as well as other exclusive art, animation, and much more!"
