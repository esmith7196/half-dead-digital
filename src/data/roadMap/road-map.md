  This collection was created by Dan Yatsinko, inspired by the delicate balance
  between life and death. Half Dead is a collection of 4,000 randomly generated,
  unique artworks encoded on the Solana blockchain.

  # ORIGIN STORY:

  On top of a hill, in the far corner of town lived an old inventor. His enormous house looked as if it was once alive but now beginning to slowly decompose from the inside out. He had no real friends, or family and the towns people hated him. None of which had a real reason to, in reality they just didn’t understand him . He was unique… One of a kind… a rarity. They thought he was weird and treated him like a complete outsider even though he lived there for over 50 years. 

  One dark night, under a blood red moon he decided to make his own friends and family. However, what he created was not fully alive, but rather half dead. More comparable to a zombie pet - far from a human companion - but the inventor didn’t care! He had friends…. FINALLY! These friends may be the embodiment of pure evil but they love and protect him…. No one else gets the inventor like they do, because they are living extensions of him.

  Still to this day they follow his lead and do whatever he says…. which sometimes means wreaking havoc on the unsuspecting towns people.
