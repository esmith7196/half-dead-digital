  "aboutDescription": "There are millions of NFT’s for sale, and it seems like thousands of new projects are launching daily. How do you cut through all the noise to determine the best NFT projects to follow and potentially invest in?\n\nFor one, and depending on how much money you are looking to spend, you may not want to look at NFT’s as an investment. There are currently 4 million assets on OpenSea (the most popular NFT marketplace) and potentially millions across other marketplaces like (Rarible, Foundation, SuperRare, NBA Top Shot, and more). Knowing that the NFT universe is immense and ever-expanding, it is safe to say not all these assets will appreciate."
